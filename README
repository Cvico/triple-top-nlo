### Triple top-quark production at NLO in QCD ###

Bash scripts to compute triple top-quark production (tttj and tttw) at NLO in QCD with MG5_aMC

The fact ttt(w>jj) looks just like an extra parton emission from tttj, and that ttt(t>bw) looks just like an extra parton emission from tttw, demands a substraction scheme at NLO in the five flavour scheme (5FS) and already at LO in the 4FS for tttw.

So-called DR1 is implemented for this purpose, by removing unwanted resonant diagrams from the set of real radiations, though specific patches of the standard MG5_aMC output.

The 5FS is adopted for NLO computations. At LO, the 4FS is also amenable and used for comparison.

Examples: Few plots are provided as examples for tttbarj and tttbarW-, displaying scale variation for two different central choices (HT/2 and sum[masses]).

Prerequisites:
- MG5_aMC_v3.4.1, lhapdf6, and their dependencies (see scripts for commented out installation code)
- set PYTHON, MG, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly in each script

To produce the tttbarj HT/2 plot, run:
- gen_tttjm.sh with "order=NLO" near line 100
- gen_tttjm.sh with "order=LO" (and the MG output generation lines commented out)
- gen_tttjm_4fs_lo.sh
- read_syslog.py <pdf-plot-output> <NLO-parton_systematics.log-file> <LO-sys-log> <4FS-LO-sys-log>

For the sum[masses] scale, rerun the same chain with "set fixed_ren_scale True" and "set fixed_fac_scale True" in both gen_tttjm*.sh scripts.

For tttW-, use the gen_tttwm*.sh scripts instead.

Scripts are also also provided to run ttbartbarj (tttjp.sh) and ttbartbarW+ (tttwp.sh) at NLO in the 5FS.
