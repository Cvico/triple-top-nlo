# Triple top-quark production at NLO in QCD ###

Bash scripts to compute triple top-quark production (tttj and tttw) at NLO in QCD with MG5_aMC (orders αS³α² and αS⁴α, respectively)

These scripts have been slightly modified for CMS usage. **None of the relevant features have been modified**, we just merely
export CVMFS libraries to make use of them while generating events.

## Install MG+LHAPDF
The production requires Madgraph5_aMC@NLO v3.4.2 and LHAPDF6 installation. In order to run the setup:
`./create_gridpack 1`

This will set up everything and install MG code under `MG5_aMC_v3_4_2`.

## Generate basic folder
`./create_gridpack 2 $process`

Where process can be any script within this repository (without the `.sh` extension). 
**Note**: For the moment, until analyser confirms, we haven't adapted the `*_lox.sh` ones, as 
in principle they did not explicitly ask for them.

This will generate some events, and prepare the necessary templates to keep generating events
without having to recompile everything (just as we do with gridpacks).

## Generate events
### Single machine
In single-machine mode one can simply do:
```
cd $process 
python3 ./bin/generate_events -o -x -p
```
### Batch mode
TBD.
