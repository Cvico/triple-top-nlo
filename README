### Triple top-quark production at NLO in QCD ###

Bash scripts to compute triple top-quark production (tttj and tttw) at NLO in QCD with MG5_aMC (orders αS³α² and αS⁴α, respectively)

The fact ttt(w>jj) looks just like an extra parton emission from tttj, and that ttt(t>bw) looks just like an extra parton emission from tttw, demands a substraction scheme at NLO in the five flavour scheme (5FS) and already at LO in the 4FS for tttw.

So-called DR1 "diagram removal" is implemented for this purpose, by removing unwanted resonant diagrams from the set of real radiations, through specific patches of the MG5_aMC outputs.

The 5FS is adopted for NLO computations. At LO, the 4FS is also amenable and used for comparison.

Plots are provided as examples, displaying scale variation for two different central choices (HT/2 and sum[masses]), in 13 TeV pp collisions. The same NNPDF23_nlo_as_0118 set is used for all LO and NLO results shown.

Prerequisites:
- MG5_aMC_v3.4.1, lhapdf6, and their dependencies (see scripts for commented out installation code)
- PYTHON, MG, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH set correctly in each script

To produce the tttbarj plots:
- gen_tttjm.sh will run NLO and LO for both choices of scales,
- gen_tttjm_4fs_lo.sh will run LO 4FS for both choices of scales,
- read_syslog.py <output-file-name> <NLO-sys-log> <LO-sys-log> [<LO-4FS-sys-log>] will produce a plot from the <run-directory>/Events/<run-name>/parton_systematics.log files. When <LO-4FS-sys-log> is provided, the corresponding scale variation (more diagonal) is superimposed together with that of <LO-sys-log> (more horizontal) in the first plot panel. The contours show 20% steps up and down from the central point.
- read_syslog_scalepdf.py <sys-log-files> will print out the factor-of-two scale variation along muR=muF and PDF uncertainties.

For tttbarW-, use the gen_tttwm.sh and gen_tttwm_4fs_lo.sh scripts instead.

Scripts are also also provided to run ttbartbarj (gen_tttjp.sh) and ttbartbarW+ (gen_tttwp.sh) at NLO in the 5FS, and to obtain formally subleading LO EW contributions (gen_ttt*_lox.sh).

Numerical results for the four processes in 13 TeV pp collisions, with factor-of-two variations around HT/2 dynamical renormalisation and factorisation scales, are given below (see also sample outputs at the end of each script file). PDF uncertainties are from NNPDF23_nlo_as_0118 replicas. The LO1 numbers only include terms of O(αS²α²) for tttj and O(αS³α) for tttw, and NLO1 only increments the power of αS. The LO(x+1) order trades one power of αS for one power of α with, respect to the LOx order.
